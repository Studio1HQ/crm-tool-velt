Design a world-class, visually sophisticated CRM Inbox UI for a sales tool. Draw inspiration from Apollo’s inbox, Attio’s clean data tables and deal views, and HubSpot’s advanced interaction paradigms. Pay special attention to visual polish, ease of use, and seamless, modern theming.A. Navbar RequirementsProduct Logo / Brand Name: Visible at the far left in the navbar, using clean, modern typography.User Avatars & User Switching:Prominently display the current user’s avatar at the right end of the navbar.On avatar click, expand a dropdown to show all available users, each with their avatar, name, and online status (colored dot or ring).Indicate active user through highlight (border, shadow, or different background).Allow simple switching between users by avatar or name selection.Online User Presence:Show an always-updated indicator of which users are online, directly in the dropdown or as badges on avatars—use color-coding for status (green for online, gray for offline).On hover or tap, show user tooltip with presence (“Online” or “Offline”).Theme Switcher:Include clear UI for toggling light/dark mode (moon/sun icon or stylish toggle).Immediate theme transition on switch using smooth fade/slide animation.All navbar elements, avatars, menus, and dropdowns adapt to the selected theme.Polish & Responsiveness:Elevate with subtle shadows, tasteful separators, rounded-corner interaction elements.Keyboard and mobile-friendly; compact into a hamburger or stacking layout on smaller screens.All navbar controls retain accessibility for assistive tech.B. Main CRM Inbox StructureSidebar Navigation (Left Column):Vertical menu anchored to left, mimicking Apollo/Attio; list lead segments (e.g., “Interested”, “Cold”, “Onboarding”, etc.) as tabs, favorites, and quick filters.Subtle highlight for active segment/tab; smooth animated transition on selection.Secondary navigation for tasks, reports, automations, onboarding, etc., beneath main segment tabs as in the supplied screenshot.Central Table Pane – Cell View (Key Focus):Crisp, data-dense list/table of leads (deals), highly inspired by your attached screenshot and Attio’s cell styling.Columns: Company (with logo/avatar), Domains (clickable, styled links), Associated deals (badges/pills), Stage, Value, Owner, Last Activity, ICP Fit, Estimated ARR, Connection Strength, etc. Allow easy configuration of visible columns.Cell Comments:On hover or icon click within any eligible cell (e.g., “Stage”, “Value”), display quick-add/view comment bubble—mirroring Attio/HubSpot UX.Support full inline comment threads per cell, with:Instant comment viewing and editing in a popover/modal.@-mention for teammates.Nested, threaded discussions (reply, delete, resolve, pin).Emoji reactions for lightweight acknowledgments.Indicator (icon/badge or colored dot) visible on cells containing unresolved or active comments.Ensure fast, low-friction UX for rapidly checking and resolving notes and follow-ups.Responsive for mobile and accessible from the keyboard.Visual State Cues:Distinct icons or highlight chips for leads/deals requiring attention (e.g., stale, overdue action, comments unresolved, or tasks due).C. Deal/Lead Detail PaneOpens on row or lead click (right side/drawer/popup as per Apollo/Attio).Contains:Full conversation timeline (notes, emails, activities).Inline editing for core attributes (owner, stage).File attachment area.List of all relevant comments, linked to their cell/source for context.Actionable summary of deal history with clearly dated entries.D. Collaborative Features & Workflow(If including, as per your original requirements: tagging collaborators in comments, quick task assign from comments, all comments syncing across cell/timeline/global feed.)Support bulk lead actions—multi-select rows for assignment, status change, or grouped updates.E. Theming & StyleDark/Light Theme Support:All views and controls must adapt instantly to both themes; avoid pure black/white, using nuanced blues/grays and slightly off-whites for optimal legibility and modern appeal.Tone down brand color intensity for dark mode, ensuring good contrast.Interaction Polish:Subtle animated transitions on theme toggle, dropdowns, and modal/hover states.Micro-interactions for hovers, focus, and state changes (e.g., comment added, user switched).Accessibility:ARIA labels, keyboard navigable, screen-reader friendly.F. UX Best PracticesMinimal, hierarchy-driven UI with no clutter—focus on actionable information.Quick search/filter box spanning all leads, comments, and activities.Keyboard shortcuts for major actions (e.g., open comment, switch segment, theme toggle).Visual feedback for error, loading, and success states.G. Inspiration & ReferenceReference the attached table cell visual style for the core look and feel.See Attio's UI for minimalist comment triggers and navigation split, plus HubSpot/Linear for context switching and theming polish.Prioritize easy visual parsing, rapid action, and modern SaaS design language throughout.Strict Exclusions:Do not add full comment-thread UI inside this brief if not needed. You can omit advanced comment/collaboration modules if building those with Velt separately—focus on the navigation, table, and structural polish per the details above.please refer to the image attached
